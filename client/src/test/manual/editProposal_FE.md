# Edit thesis proposal

This file contains a report about the FE testing on the procedure of editing an already-present thesis proposal.

# Teachers view

The accept/decline applications component should be accesible only by teachers so we are going to try to access it using the teacher account and look through the applications to our thesis proposals.

Results:

When logged into the teacher account we can access the applications section by clicking in the navigation bar.

## Accepting/declining an application

Using the buttons we can accept or decline the application, which appears in the corresponding section after accepting/declining it. (For this test we are going to accept an application)

In this case, the application coming from Simone Marino for the "Autonomous Robot Navigation using Machine Learning" thesis that we accepted is shown in the accepted applications.
