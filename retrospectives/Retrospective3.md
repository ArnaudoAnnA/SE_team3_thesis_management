## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Estimated Hours per task average: ~2h
- Actual Hours per task average: ~1h 55m
- Estimated Hours Standard deviation:  14h 30m
- Actual Hours Standard deviation: 14h

- Total task estimation error ratio [(sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent) - 1]:  |(6990/6455)-1|  = |0,082| = 8,2%

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  Since one of our members could not work his estimated 16h we had to rearrange the tasks and the hours spent on them. This caused some of the tasks to be underestimated and some to be overestimated. However, we managed to complete all the tasks in time.


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  We learned that sometimes things doesn't go as planned and that we have to be flexible and adapt to the situation. We also learned that we have to be more careful when estimating the hours for each task.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
  We are improved in the estimation of the hours for each task.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  None

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  
  Improve even more the estimation of the hours for each task.
  Plan some time to prepare the demo and the presentation of the project.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

  We are very proud of how we handled the situation with one of our members that could not work for some time. We didn't panic and we managed to complete all the tasks in time.
