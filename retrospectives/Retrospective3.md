The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done 



- Total points committed vs done 



- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)



**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Manual FE testing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD

  - Total hours spent
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube

  - Hours spent on remediation 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability")
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )
  
## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?



- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?


- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
