RETROSPECTIVE 2 (Team 3)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done

4/4

- Total points committed vs. done

9/9

- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

109h 15m/99h 55m

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Manual FE testing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   18    |    -   |   60h 15m  |   56h 50m    |
| _#4_   |    5    |    3   |    22h     |   19h 55m    |
| _#5_   |    4    |    2   |    10h     |     8h       |
| _#6_   |    4    |    2   |    12h     |   11h 30m    |
| _#7_   |    4    |    2   |     5h     |    3h 40m    |

- _#0_ corresponds to start meeting, daily scrum meetings and previous issues fix
- _#4_ : Browse Applications
- _#5_ : Accept Application
- _#6_ : Browse Applications Decisions
- _#7_ : Browse Proposals

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Estimated Hours per task average: 3h 7m
- Actual Hours per task average: 2h 51m
- Estimated Hours Standard deviation: 2h 48m
- Actual Hours Standard deviation: 

- Total task estimation error ratio [(sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent) - 1]:  /  = || = 

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent:  
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?


- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?


- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
