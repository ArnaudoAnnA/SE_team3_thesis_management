TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done 

7 / 7

- Total points committed vs done 

33 / 33

- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)

113h 30m / 112h 5m


**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Manual FE testing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Estimated Hours per task average: 2h 21m
- Actual Hours per task average: 2h 20m
- Estimated Hours Standard deviation: 
- Actual Hours Standard deviation:

- Total task estimation error ratio [(sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent) - 1]:  |(6810/6725)-1|  = |0,012| = 1,2%

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated:
  - Total hours spent 
  - Nr of automated unit test cases
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent 
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent 
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent 
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube 
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues 
  - Hours spent on remediation 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): %
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )
    - reliability: 
    - security: 
    - maintainability: 
  
## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?


- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?


- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
