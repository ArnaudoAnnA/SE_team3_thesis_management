RETROSPECTIVE 1 (Team 3)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done

 

- Total points committed vs. done



- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)



**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |     13   |    -   |    97h      |  99h 20m     |
| _#1_   |     4   |    5   |      12h 30m     |    15h 20m    |
| _#2_   |    6    |    5   |      22h    |      33h 25m      |
| _#3_   |    4    |    2   |     8h    |       9h 40m      |

- _#0_ corresponds to 
- _#1_ : Insert proposal
- _#2_ : Search proposal
- _#3_ : Apply for proposal

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Estimated Hours per task average: 5h
- Actual Hours per task average: 6h
- Estimated Hours Standard deviation: 
- Actual Hours Standard deviation: 

- Total task estimation error ratio [(sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent) - 1]: 

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 
  - Coverage (if available):
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?


- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?


- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
